# First-Come, First-Served and Priority (FCFS and Priority) Scheduler GUI

## Overview

The **FCFS Scheduler GUI** is a Java-based project aimed at illustrating fundamental principles of process scheduling within operating systems. This graphical user interface (GUI) empowers users to interactively input the arrival times and burst durations of processes, providing a visual representation of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm in action.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Input:** Users can input the number of processes, along with arrival and burst times for each process, through an intuitive GUI.
  
- **FCFS Scheduling:** The project implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm, a simple and straightforward approach that schedules processes based on their arrival times.

- **Sortable Display:** Scheduling results are presented in a tabular format, with columns for process ID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.

- **Clear Functionality:** A "Clear" button allows users to reset input fields easily, providing a seamless way to initiate new simulations.

- **Average Metrics:** The project calculates and displays average waiting time and average turnaround time for the executed FCFS scheduling.

## Educational Context

This project is designed as a visual aid for students studying operating systems. It serves as a practical example of a scheduling algorithm, offering hands-on experience in understanding how processes are scheduled in a simplified operating system context.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:** Execute the application.
  
2. **Input Process Details:** Input the number of processes, as well as their corresponding arrival and burst times.

3. **Execute FCFS:** Click the "Execute FCFS" button to visualize the FCFS scheduling algorithm.

4. **Review Results:** Examine the displayed results, including detailed process scheduling information and average metrics.

5. **Clear Input:** Use the "Clear" button to reset input fields for a new simulation.

## Note

This project is designed for educational purposes, providing a simplified demonstration of a scheduling algorithm. It can serve as a valuable resource for students learning about operating systems and process scheduling.
